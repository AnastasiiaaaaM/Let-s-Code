## Let's Code

Coding Academy

**New to coding?** Thatâ€™s not a problem! We will go from no coding experience to structuring
web pages with HTML, styling them with CSS, and adding dynamic functionality using
JavaScript. If you are curious about how websites are built and want to try - you are
welcome!
 
**Why do you need that?** If you are a marketer who is trying to customize email templates,
landing pages, and WordPress sites. Or you are a Product Manager or Designer working
with a dev team on a web application. In our classes, we will empower you to take on tasks
yourself and communicate more effectively with your in-house and outsourced development
teams.
